# MET WeatherAPI documentation documentation

This repo contains (at some point in the future) most of the docs on
api.met.no which are not autogenerated from module POD or metadata.

The content is designed primarily to be shown at
[https://api.met.no/doc/](https://api.met.no/doc/),
but is also visible for debugging purposes at
[https://metno.github.io/weatherapi-docs/doc/locationforecast/HowTO](https://metno.github.io/weatherapi-docs/doc/locationforecast/HowTO)

It is also possible to add documents intended for export
to the [Yr Developer Portal](https://developer.yr.no/).

## Structure

Due to GitHub limitations, all api doc pages must reside in the `doc` directory.
Files which are not indented to be processed as Markdown but still included
in WeatherAPI (e.g. XML schemas) may be stored in other directories.

## Format

Markdown must adhere to the sub/superset supported by
[Text::MultiMarkdown](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::MultiMarkdown).

## Links

Since text can be displayed under many different subdomains, all links must
be [root-relative](https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40-970917/htmlweb.html#h-5.1.2),
e.g.

    ... see [locationforecast](/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/) for info.
